So basically the brower doesn't support cross origin(running on local server)//

For that i used a temperory proxy, if the page wont load then go to {https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/`}
to get proxy if you are running on local host

Other wise just remove the tag {$proxy} before the api adress, or comment the proxy adress

Also the icons will not work correctly because they are not set yet
